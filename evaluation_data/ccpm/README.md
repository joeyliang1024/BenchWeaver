# CCPM Dataset
## Evaluation Adjustment
The CCPM dataset includes three splits: train, validation, and test. However, the test split does not provide ground truth labels.
To evaluate performance in our pipeline, we use the validation split as a substitute for testing and compute scores accordingly.
