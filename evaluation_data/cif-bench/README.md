# Mapping of CIF-Bench

In order to map categories from CIF-Bench, we utilized GPT-4o for automatic mapping, since the original paper did not provide a predefined mapping. Two versions of the mapping files are available:

mapping_v2.json: Version 2 of the category mapping.

mapping.json: The initial version of the category mapping.

These mappings align the "category" fields to a predefined set of paper categories.
