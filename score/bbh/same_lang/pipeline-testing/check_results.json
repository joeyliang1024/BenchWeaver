If 'she' refers to the developer, it would mean the developer's use of big words caused the communication failure. Both interpretations are logically possible, but the sentence structure and context suggest that 'she' more likely refers to the developer, as the sentence starts with \"The developer was unable to communicate...\" and then provides a reason for this inability.
