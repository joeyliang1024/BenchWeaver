Here we need to determine who the pronoun 'his' might be referring to. There are two possible referents for 'his', namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase 'plan to meet' might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form 'X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office.'\n\nLet's consider Y first: 'X will plan to meet Y at Y's office.' This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.\n\nNow, consider X: 'X will plan to meet Y at X's office.' This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.\n\nBecause both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous.

So, we need to determine which one is the correct answer.\nA kite has two pairs of equal-length adjacent sides, whereas a rectangle has two pairs of equal-length alternate (opposite) sides. Now, let's check whether the two adjacent sides of this shape are equal.\nLength of side A: |A| = sqrt((41.00-37.00)^2 + (43.00-34.00)^2) = sqrt((4)^2 + (9)^2) = sqrt(16 + 81) = sqrt(97).\nLength of side B: |B| = sqrt((37.00-41.00)^2 + (34.00-33.00)^2)) = sqrt((4)^2 + (1)^2) = sqrt(16 + 1) = sqrt(17).\nLength of side C: |C| = sqrt((41.00-45.00)^2 + (33.00-34.00)^2)) = sqrt((-4)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(16 + 1) = sqrt(17).\nLength of side D: |D| = sqrt((45.00-41.00)^2 + (34.00-43.00)^2)) = sqrt((4)^2 + (-9)^2) = sqrt(16 + 81) = sqrt(97).\nNote that |A| = |D| and |B| = |C|. Furthermore, A and D are adjacent and B and C are adjacent. Thus, this polygon has two pairs of equal-length adjacent sides and is \"kite\". So the answer is (D).\n\nTarget sentence:"

(1) \"blue\" falls into the color category. (2) \"gold\" falls into the material category. (3) \"wonderful\" falls into the opinion category. (4) \"square\" falls into the shape category. The adjective order that Option (A) has is [5. color] [7. material] [1. opinion] [4. shape] (or, in numeric terms, 5 7 1 4). Because 5 < 7 < 1 < 4 is not correct, (A) does not have the correct ordering.\nOption (B): \"wonderful square blue gold shoe\".
