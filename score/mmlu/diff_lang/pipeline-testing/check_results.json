Since disk seek time and disk latency time are constant and do not depend on the block size, they remain the same for both versions. However, the disk transfer time and operating system overhead will change based on the block size.\n\nFor version 1 (1,000 bytes block size):\n- Disk transfer time: 1 msec\n- Operating system overhead: 1 msec + 10 msec = 11 msec\n- Total time per block: 25 msec (seek) + 8 msec (latency) + 1 msec (transfer) + 11 msec (overhead) = 45 msec\n\nFor version 2 (4,000 bytes block size):\n- Disk transfer time: 4 msec (since it's 1 msec per 1,000 bytes)\n- Operating system overhead: 4 msec (since it's 1 msec per 1,000 bytes) + 10 msec = 14 msec\n- Total time per block: 25 msec (seek) + 8 msec (latency) + 4 msec (transfer) + 14 msec (overhead) = 51 msec\n\nSince the file is large, we can assume that the number of blocks read is large enough that the seek and latency times are relatively constant.

The response does not mention that the test is a two-tailed test, which is appropriate for testing whether the mean weight of the tablets is different from 300 milligrams. This means the P-value should be doubled to account for both tails of the distribution, leading to the correct answer being B.\n\n2.

The response does not calculate the sample mean (M) or the sample standard deviation (s) to compute the t-statistic, which is necessary to determine the P-value.

The response correctly identifies the degrees of freedom as 6 (df = n - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6), but it fails to account for the two-tailed nature of the test, which would double the P-value.\n\nGiven these points, the correct answer is B, not C.",
